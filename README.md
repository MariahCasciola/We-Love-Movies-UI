"What's a cinephile?"

-Young Neil, Scott Pilgrim vs the World

I am a cinephile with a love for all sorts of niche movies. I love Studio Ghibliâ€™s Spirited Away, BladeRunner, Rear Window, Spiderman: Into the Spider-Verse, and more. Please enjoy this list of movies I have compiled in this API! Sit back, grab some popcorn, and enjoy!
